<h2>Project Two for CS-210 at Southern New Hampshire University</h2>

________

<i>"You will develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. Airgead Banking has provided you with a list of functional requirements that describe what they need their application to do."
</i><br>
<br>
<b>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</b>
1. Airgead Banking wants a screen to display with the following information:<br>
   • Initial Investment Amount: The starting amount of your investment (a positive real number)<br>
   • Monthly Deposit: The amount you plan to contribute to the growth of your investment each month (a positive real number)<br>
   • Annual Interest (Compounded): Interest that is added to the principal sum of your investment and its previously accumulated interest (interest on interest and principal)<br>
   • Number of Years: The number of years your investment has to grow<br>
   • A way to see the data (for example: “Press any key to continue…”) 
2. When the user continues, the console should display two static reports. One should show the year-end balances and year-end earned interest if no additional monthly deposits are made. The second should show the year-end balances and year-end earned interest based on the monthly deposit value that was input by the user.
3. The user should be able to test different monthly deposit amounts, interest rates, and lengths of time to see how increases and decreases impact their investment growth.  
4. Your code will need to account for the following:<br>
   a. Month: The number of months based on user input in the “Number of Years” field.<br>
   b. Opening Amount: The initial investment amount as well as the opening balance each month, which includes interest.<br>
   c. Deposited Amount: The dollar amount the user plans to deposit each month. This value will be the same every month for the duration of the investment.<br>
   d. Total: The sum of the opening and deposited amounts.<br>
   e. Interest: Money earned based on the “annual interest” rate input by the user.<br>
   f. Closing Balance: The sum of the total and interest amounts.
5. It is important to note that the institution not only adheres to banking best practices but also complies with industry regulations. To ensure consistency and quality, Airgead Banking requires that all developers follow a set of strict best practices rules so that all written code is transferable, readable, and reusable.
